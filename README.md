# Project: Positioning and Floating elements [HTML/CSS]

## Description

This project was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s [HTML/CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css). The goal of the project is to produce a not-so-exact replica of a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) utilising CSS flexbox and grid properties. The purpose is to strengthen some of the skills learnt during the original foundation course and better understand element positioning.
